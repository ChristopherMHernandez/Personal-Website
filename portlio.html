		<dt> Lego Marble Sorter</dt>
		<dd>In this project, we use a lego mindstorm kit to create a color sorter. We had to create an effective way to get supplies by the color of the marble. When we got the color of marble it had told the machine where the supplies was going to in the project. We had to use color sensors to read the barcode to tell the program what it was going to do. In this project, I had use labview to do the entire project.</dd>

		<dt>Personal Website</dt>
		<dd>In this project, we had created a personal website about us to present to either companies or other people. I had decided to create my own program from scratch instead of using online templates to help me code. I used local pages to help me get an inspiration so that I can create my own page.</dd>
		<img style="width:10%" style="transform:rotate(90deg)" src="traffic light.jfif" alt="traffic light"align="middle">
		<dt>Traffic Signal</dt>
		<dd>In project I had built a traffic light using a finite state machine from what i had learned in the previous lab. I had written the code in Verilog. In order to make the traffic light I had used an ZYBO board. I had program the board using the code that I had program in verilog and uplloaded it to the board. I was creating a traffic light at intersection with a farm road and busy roadway.</dd>

        <dt>Eletronic Security Signal</dt>
		<dd>In this project, I had used my AD2 to create an electronic alarm. I had used a combination of resistors and opamps to make the the signal. When their was something obstructing our emitter a red light would turn on. If not a green light would stay mentioning that there was nothing blocking the emitter.</dd>

<p>If you view more of my projects feel free to stop by my githubs.My personal github contains my previous code from different classes that I have taken here at Texas A&M. I am slowly 
transitioning over my code to my school github. Both of my githubs will be posted at the bottom:</p>
